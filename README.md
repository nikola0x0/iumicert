> **Enhancing credential verification through verifiable academic micro-credential provenance using Verkle trees**

## 📖 Overview

IU-MiCert is a blockchain-based system designed to address critical limitations in current academic credential verification by implementing verifiable micro-credential provenance. The system leverages **Verkle tree technology** as an improvement over traditional Merkle trees to provide:

- 🛡️ Enhanced anti-forgery mechanisms through temporal verification
- 📈 Efficient storage and verification of granular learning achievements
- 🔗 Seamless integration with existing credential management systems
- ⏳ Comprehensive audit trail of learning achievements with verifiable timestamps

## 🎯 Motivation

Traditional credential systems treat courses as isolated achievements without preserving the temporal context of a student's learning journey. IU-MiCert addresses this by:

- Treating individual courses as verifiable micro-credentials
- Enabling term-by-term verification of academic progress
- Maintaining a complete, tamper-proof academic provenance timeline
- Preventing backdating and timeline manipulation of achievements
- Supporting selective disclosure while preserving cryptographic integrity

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Current blockchain credential systems:

- Focus primarily on whole degree verification
- Create opportunities for credential forgery through timeline gaps
- Use Merkle trees that become inefficient at scale

IU-MiCert implements **Verkle tree structures** to address these challenges while maintaining compatibility with existing systems.

### Key Components:

- **Verkle Tree Manager**: Efficient storage/verification of micro-credentials
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated credential issuance with term-based cycles
- **Commitment Engine**: Minimizes on-chain storage while maintaining provenance
- **Verification Protocols**: Efficient proof validation at scale
